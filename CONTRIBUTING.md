The kratos community wants to be helped by a wide range of developers, so you'd like to take a few minutes to read this guide before you mention the problem or pull request.

## Reporting Bug or Fixing Bugs
We use GitHub issues to manage issues. If you want to submit , first make sure you've searched for existing issues, pull requests and read our [FAQ](https://go-kratos.dev/docs/intro/faq).

When submitting a bug report, use the issue template we provide to clearly describe the problems encountered and how to reproduce, and if convenient it is best to provide a minimal reproduce repository.

## Adding new features

In order to accurately distinguish whether the needs put forward by users are the needs or reasonable needs of most users, solicit opinions from the community through the proposal process, and the proposals adopted by the community will be realized as new feature.
In order to make the proposal process as simple as possible, the process includes three stages: proposal, feature and PR, in which proposal, feature is issue and PR is the specific function implementation.
In order to facilitate the community to correctly understand the requirements of the proposal, the proposal issue needs to describe the functional requirements and relevant references or literature in detail.
When most community users agree with this proposal, they will create a feature issue associated with the proposal issue.
The feature issue needs to describe the implementation method and function demonstration in detail as a reference for the final function implementation.
After the function is implemented, a merge request will be initiated to associate the proposal issue and feature issue.
After the merge is completed, Close all issues.

## How to submit code
If you've never submitted code on GitHub, follow these steps:

- First, please fork items to your GitHub account
- Then create a new feature branch based on the main branch and name it features such as feature-log
- Write code
- Submit code to the far end branch
- Submit a PR request in github
- Wait for review and merge to the main branch

**Note That when you submit a PR request, you first ensure that the code uses the correct coding specifications and that there are complete test cases, and that the information in the submission of the PR is best associated with the relevant issue to ease the workload of the auditor.**

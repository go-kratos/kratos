  // Execute an action remotely.
  //
  // In order to execute an action, the client must first upload all of the
  // inputs, as well as the
  // [Command][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Command] to run, into the
  // [ContentAddressableStorage][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.ContentAddressableStorage].
  // It then calls `Execute` with an
  // [Action][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Action] referring to them.
  // The server will run the action and eventually return the result.
  //
  // The input `Action`'s fields MUST meet the various canonicalization
  // requirements specified in the documentation for their types so that it has
  // the same digest as other logically equivalent `Action`s. The server MAY
  // enforce the requirements and return errors if a non-canonical input is
  // received. It MAY also proceed without verifying some or all of the
  // requirements, such as for performance reasons. If the server does not
  // verify the requirement, then it will treat the `Action` as distinct from
  // another logically equivalent action if they hash differently.
  //
  // Returns a [google.longrunning.Operation][google.longrunning.Operation]
  // describing the resulting execution, with eventual `response`
  // [ExecuteResponse][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.ExecuteResponse].
  // The `metadata` on the operation is of type
  // [ExecuteOperationMetadata][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.ExecuteOperationMetadata].
  //
  // To query the operation, you can use the
  // [Operations API][google.longrunning.Operations.GetOperation]. If you wish
  // to allow the server to stream operations updates, rather than requiring
  // client polling, you can use the
  // [Watcher API][google.watcher.v1.Watcher.Watch] with the Operation's `name`
  // as the `target`.
  //
  // When using the Watcher API, the initial `data` will be the `Operation` at
  // the time of the request. Updates will be provided periodically by the
  // server until the `Operation` completes, at which point the response message
  // will (assuming no error) be at `data.response`.
  //
  // The server NEED NOT implement other methods or functionality of the
  // Operation and Watcher APIs.
  //
  // Errors discovered during creation of the `Operation` will be reported
  // as gRPC Status errors, while errors that occurred while running the
  // action will be reported in the `status` field of the `ExecuteResponse`. The
  // server MUST NOT set the `error` field of the `Operation` proto.
  // The possible errors include:
  // * `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: One or more arguments are invalid.
  // * `FAILED_PRECONDITION`: One or more errors occurred in setting up the
  //   action requested, such as a missing input or command or no worker being
  //   available. The client may be able to fix the errors and retry.
  // * `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`: There is insufficient quota of some resource to run
  //   the action.
  // * `UNAVAILABLE`: Due to a transient condition, such as all workers being
  //   occupied (and the server does not support a queue), the action could not
  //   be started. The client should retry.
  // * `INTERNAL`: An internal error occurred in the execution engine or the
  //   worker.
  // * `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`: The execution timed out.
  //
  // In the case of a missing input or command, the server SHOULD additionally
  // send a [PreconditionFailure][google.rpc.PreconditionFailure] error detail
  // where, for each requested blob not present in the CAS, there is a
  // `Violation` with a `type` of `MISSING` and a `subject` of

// The CAS (content-addressable storage) is used to store the inputs to and

// Most of the binary data stored in the CAS is opaque to the execution engine,
// and is only used as a communication medium. In order to build an
// [Action][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Action],
// however, the client will need to also upload the
// [Command][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Command] and input root
// [Directory][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Directory] for the Action.
// The Command and Directory messages must be marshalled to wire format and then
// uploaded under the hash as with any other piece of content. In practice, the
// input root directory is likely to refer to other Directories in its
// hierarchy, which must also each be uploaded on their own.
//
// For small file uploads the client should group them together and call
// [BatchUpdateBlobs][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.ContentAddressableStorage.BatchUpdateBlobs]
// on chunks of no more than 10 MiB. For large uploads, the client must use the
// [Write method][google.bytestream.ByteStream.Write] of the ByteStream API. The
// `resource_name` is `{instance_name}/uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}`,
// where `instance_name` is as described in the next paragraph, `uuid` is a
// version 4 UUID generated by the client, and `hash` and `size` are the
// [Digest][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Digest] of the blob. The
// `uuid` is used only to avoid collisions when multiple clients try to upload
// the same file (or the same client tries to upload the file multiple times at
// once on different threads), so the client MAY reuse the `uuid` for uploading
// different blobs. The `resource_name` may optionally have a trailing filename
// (or other metadata) for a client to use if it is storing URLs, as in
// `{instance}/uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}/foo/bar/baz.cc`. Anything
// after the `size` is ignored.
//
// A single server MAY support multiple instances of the execution system, each
// with their own workers, storage, cache, etc. The exact relationship between
// instances is up to the server. If the server does, then the `instance_name`
// is an identifier, possibly containing multiple path segments, used to
// distinguish between the various instances on the server, in a manner defined
// by the server. For servers which do not support multiple instances, then the
// `instance_name` is the empty path and the leading slash is omitted, so that
// the `resource_name` becomes `uploads/{uuid}/blobs/{hash}/{size}`.
//
// When attempting an upload, if another client has already completed the upload
// (which may occur in the middle of a single upload if another client uploads
// the same blob concurrently), the request will terminate immediately with
// a response whose `committed_size` is the full size of the uploaded file
// (regardless of how much data was transmitted by the client). If the client
// completes the upload but the
// [Digest][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Digest] does not match, an
// `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error will be returned. In either case, the client should
// not attempt to retry the upload.
//
// For downloading blobs, the client must use the
// [Read method][google.bytestream.ByteStream.Read] of the ByteStream API, with
// a `resource_name` of `"{instance_name}/blobs/{hash}/{size}"`, where
// `instance_name` is the instance name (see above), and `hash` and `size` are
// the [Digest][google.devtools.remoteexecution.v1test.Digest] of the blob.
//
// The lifetime of entries in the CAS is implementation specific, but it SHOULD
// be long enough to allow for newly-added and recently looked-up entries to be

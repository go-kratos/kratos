// This message defines the standard attribute vocabulary for Google APIs.
//
// An attribute is a piece of metadata that describes an activity on a network
// service. For example, the size of an HTTP request, or the status code of
// an HTTP response.
//
// Each attribute has a type and a name, which is logically defined as
// a proto message field in `AttributeContext`. The field type becomes the
// attribute type, and the field path becomes the attribute name. For example,
// the attribute `source.ip` maps to field `AttributeContext.source.ip`.
//
// This message definition is guaranteed not to have any wire breaking change.
// So you can use it directly for passing attributes across different systems.
//
// NOTE: Different system may generate different subset of attributes. Please
// verify the system specification before relying on an attribute generated
// a system.
